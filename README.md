<p>
 This paper introduces VTON-IT, a novel Virtual Try-On application that uses semantic segmentation and a generative adversarial network to produce high-resolution, natural-looking images of clothes overlaid onto segmented body regions, addressing the challenges of body size, pose, and occlusions.
</p>

<p>
Below is the overview of proposed VTON-IT. First, the human body is detected and cropped. Then, the desired body region is segmented through U2-Net architecture and the segmented mask is fed to the image translation network to generate wrapped cloth. Finally, the wrapped cloth is overlayed over the input image.

## Result

For evaluating the performance of VTON-IT through visual observation, we compared the final overlayed images with the output of CP-VTON+. Image below shows that the proposed virtual try-on application produces more realistic and convincing results in terms of texture transfer quality and pose preservation.
